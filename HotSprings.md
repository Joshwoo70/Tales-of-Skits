**Comforting Katz**: You found me! Thank you so much, meow!  
**Comforting Katz**: To show you my catitude, I'd like to invite you to a nice, soothing bathhouse I found, meow!  
**Velvet**:          A bathhouse?  
**Comforting Katz**: Yep! The Super Spa! One dip in their baths and you'll feel as good as mew, inside and out!  
**Comforting Katz**: Speaking from experience, I can promise you its so amazingly purrfect, your soul will leave your body!  
**Velvet**:          Super Spa, is it?.... Wait, is that why we've been lugging around all these Katz Towels?!  
**Comforting Katz**: You got it, meow!  
**Velvet**:          Its... not a mixed bath or anything, right?  
**Comforting Katz**: No need to worry, meow! Men and women both have their own dedicated baths.  
**Velvet**:          If you insist... I could definitely stand to unwind after so much fighting.  
**Magilou**:         Mmhm. I'm positively tingling with anticipation!  
**Eizen**:           You know, it might be nice to have some serious bonding time before the final battle.  
**Laphicet**:        Actually, I've never been to a bath house before...  
**Eleanor**:         Oh, you're in for a treat. That steam will have your skin silky smooth.  
**Rokurou**:         And there's nothing like a good drink after a hot bath.  
**Comforting Katz**: This Gate of Travel will take you there straight away. Feel free to use it anytime, meow!  

Magilou:              Aaaah... You know, I'm pretty okay with this.  
Eleanor:              Ill second that. This feels really nice.  
**Velvet**:           Yeah... Its like I can feel my soul just floating off with the steam.  
Eleanor(Rokurou):     Aaah... It feels like all my wounds are melting away.  
**Magilou(Eizen)**:   I'll say. The water is just the right temperature. Soothes all the important places.  
**Velvet**(Laphicet): Wait, what... What the hell?  
**Eleanor(Rokurou)**: Don't splash the water around, Velvet! That's totally bad manners!  
**Velvet**(Laphicet): I cant help it. My legs don't reach the bottom...  
**Velvet**(Laphicet): Wait... Am I in Phi's body?!  
**Eleanor(Rokurou)**: Augh, and I'm inside Rokurou! Eww, look at these muscles!  
**Magilou(Eizen)**:   Heh, I'm actually as tall as I always wished I was! What the Devils going on in here?!  
**Katz(Bienfu)**:     This is what makes this place so special, meow.  
**Katz(Bienfu)**:     You feel so purrfectly divine that your soul floats away and switches bodies with someone else, meow!  
**Magilou(Eizen)**:   Sheesh... Looks like even Bienfu and the Katz have swapped bodies.  
**Eleanor(Rokurou)**: Wait... does that mean that the men are now in our bodies?!  
**Rokurou(Eleanor)**: Well. This place certainly wasted no time in getting weird or awkward.  
**Laphicet(Velvet)**: U-Uh... I'm not really comfortable with this. What do we do?I feel like I've got an inner tube strapped to my chest.  
**Rokurou(Eleanor)**: Eizen, is this another side-effect of your curse?  
**Eizen(Magilou)**:   As if the Reapers Curse would do something so ridiculous. It's probably just that Katz playing a prank on us.  
**Laphicet(Velvet)**: I'm amazed that you can stay so calm despite all of this, Eizen.  
**Eizen(Magilou)**:   Hah, this doesn't bother me in the least.  
**Eizen(Magilou)**:   My sister and I used to take baths together when we were kids.  
**Laphicet(Velvet)**: I suppose that... makes sense....  
**Rokurou(Eleanor)**: ...  Well, we might as well enjoy ourselves. The water here does feel quite nice.  
**Eleanor(Rokurou)**: Rokurou, you letch! Cover your eyes this instant!  
**Rokurou(Eleanor)**: Fine, fine. No need to shout, Eleanor. Though I have to say, your body is nicely agile.  
**Rokurou(Eleanor)**: Though your butt is a bit bulky.  
**Eleanor(Rokurou)**: Hey! Keep my hands to yourself!  
*Eleanor Stands up*  
**Velvet(Laphicet)**: E-Eleanor! Don't stand up!  
*After a short awkward silence, Eleanor sit back down*  
**Eizen(Magilou)**:   Hey, Katz! We better not be stuck like this forever!  
**Katz(Bienfu)**:     No need for confurn, meow. Youll all go back to normal once you leave the spring.  
**Velvet(Laphicet)**: Right then, everybody out. This is just too weird to be relaxing.  
???:                  Actually, before we go... I've noticed the Katz's been staring at us for pretty much the entire time.  
**Velvet(Laphicet)**: ...  Yeah, that's Bienfu. Smack him for me.  
**Rokurou(Eleanor)**: Got it.  
**Bienfu(Katz)**:     Bieeeeeen!  

**Rokurou**: Thats too bad... It was such a lovely hot spring. I wish wecould have stayed a little longer.  
**Eleanor**: (*Blushing/Angrily*) No, you really dont. Lets all agree to forget this ever happened.  
**Eizen**:   ... How do you expect us to do that?  
**Rokurou**: Dont go asking for things we cant actually do.  
**Eleanor**: (*Blushing/Angrily*) I SAID FORGET IT!  
**Rokurou**: If you insist... I-Ill try.  
**Eizen**:   Uh... Fine...  
**Magilou**: Yeesh... So much for a nice team-building exercise! I feellike this has just driven a wedge further between us.  

**Velvet**: I heard you kept your eyes covered the whole time.  
**Laphicet**: Y-Yeah, I did....  
**Velvet**: Hah. Thats so you.  
**Laphicet**: Whats the problem? I was just trying to be polite!  
**Velvet**: Its fine. Theres no problem.  
**Velvet**: But I didnt cover mine...  
**Laphicet**: (*Blushing*) Ah...  
**Laphicet**: *Blushing/Angrily* Argh! Velvet! Why would you even tell me that?!
