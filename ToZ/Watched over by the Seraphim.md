**Rose**:    Zzz...  
**Sorey**:   Zzz...  
**Zavied**:  It all might be too much for mere humans to bear.  
**Lailah**:  I shouldn't have taken them along... oh, it's so useless to say that now.  
**Edna**:    They could have stayed home in their rooms if they didn't want to deal with it. They went out of their own accord.  
**Mikleo**:  Yeah. And I don't think either of them expect or want anyone to take responsibility for their being dragged into this.  
**Zavied**:  Both of 'em seem so used to living with the seraphim! Wonder if they were always like this.  
**Mikleo**:  Sorey and I were raised together ever since we were just babies.  
**Zavied**:  There was a time when you were a baby?  
**Mikleo**:  That's rude!  
**Zavied**:  My bad, my bad! I'm sure you were a sweet, well-behaved little guy back in your day.  
**Mikleo**:  Too bad I'm not like that anymore, huh.
