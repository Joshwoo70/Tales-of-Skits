**Sergei**:	 I am Sergei Strelka, Captain of the Platinum Knights,  Defenders of the Glory of the Rolance Empire.  
**Sergei**:	 In cooperating to ensure the empire's peace, you prove your gratitude as much as your loyalty!  
**Edna**:	 Is he always like this, or are his boxers just chafing him?  
**Rose**:	 Here you go, our Merchant Guild pass. We've come to Lastonbell on business-- specifically, the collection of a bill.  
**Sergei**:	 The Sparrowfeathers, are you? Quite impressive.  
**Rose**:	 We've got a strict deadline. No time to waste. The place of business is the liquor establishment on the main road.  
**Sergei**:	 Ah yes, Boris' Canteen? That place certainly gets an awful lot of business.  
**Rose**:	 And we deeply appreciate being a  part of it! Is there anything else?  
**Sergei**:	 No. My gratitude for cooperating with our inspection.  
**Rose**:	 Thanks for all your hard work!  
**Sergei**:	 Next, you there. Quite some garb you're wearing. Are you this young woman's guard?  
**Rose**:	 Oh, er... A girl doesn't dare travel alone!  
**Sergei**:	 Then why does he carry an ornamental sword?  
**Mikleo**:	 He knew that Sorey's sword was ornamental?!  He's seeing right through us!  
**Dezel**:	 He's less of an idiot than he looks.  
**Rose**:	 Wait. There are people watching.  
**Dezel**:	*Looks over* Ahâ€¦  
**Rose**:	*stuttering*  Well, y'know... We have our reasons!  
**Sergei**:	 I'm asking your guard here.  
**Rose**:	 Crap.  
**Lailah**:	 Repeat after me.  
**Sorey**:	 Please forgive my unquestionably suspicious appearance. The truth is, I am the son of a provincial lard.  
**Edna**:	*Pokes Sorey due to him mis-saying Lord*  
**Sorey**:	 Lord!  
**Sergei**:	 Hm?  
**Mikleo**:	 Rose!  
**Rose**:	 That's right! My husband here is nobility!  
**Lailah**:	*Shocked*  What? You're married?!  *Rose scratches her head, Lailah and Mikleo thinks.*  
**Sorey**:	 Never had I lifted anything heavier than a fork in my life, yet by chance did I fall in love with a traveling merchant.  
**Sorey**:	 In the throes of passion, I threw my money and land away to be with her, just over a year ago.  
**Rose**:	 You...You did?  *Mikleo and lailah is shocked*  
**Sorey**:	 E-Even my wife didn't know the full truth!  
**Sorey**:	 The cruelties of the outside world taught me how feeble I truly am, but even so I knew a husband has a duty to protect his wife.  
**Sorey**:	 *Edna Holding his hand while lailah is telling him his lines* So I wear an ornamental sword at my side, as a hollow pretense of strength.  
**Sorey**:	*Mikleo helps with Sorey's other arm.. He puts it down and facepalms* Laugh... at the weak will of a sad, broken man!  
**Sorey**:	*Dezel forces Sorey to bow, almost breaking his neck* Gah!  
**Sorey**:	 Sorry...  
**Rose**:	 You're doing your best! It's cool!  *Walks over and put her hand on his shoulder*  
**Sorey**:	 Oh, my dearest! *Edna puts Sorey arms on Rose's hands* Your sweet words  are succor to my tired limbs! *Cue Mikleo Facepalming again*  
**Sergei**:	 Sow the seeds of love, and they will bloom no matter how arid the terrain.  
**Sergei**:	 Live and be strong!  
**Sergei**:	 Next!
