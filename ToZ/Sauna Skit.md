## Wicked Nekkid Wind
**Zaveid**:	 Hey Mr. Shepherd. Where's Lailah and the others?  
**Sorey**:	 They went to the sauna to relax.  
**Zaveid**:	 Oh snap! Sorey, let's hit up the sauna!  
**Sorey**:	 Eh, maybe later.  
**Zaveid**:	 Come on, don't be such a buzzkill! We men need to be open and comfortable about things like this! You know, a naked relationship!  
**Sorey**:	 Well, you are always half naked, Zaveid.  
**Zaveid**:	 I may look like an exhibitionist when it comes to my body, but the door to my heart is always closed! That's why I wanted to take this time to bond with you!  
**Zaveid**:	 You know, like, as an accomplice.  
**Sorey**:	 Don't tell me you're going to read the wind to snoop around the girls' sauna?  
**Zaveid**:	 Oh ho? You're pretty sharp after all, you no good Shepherd, you!  
**Sorey**:	 I don't think this is a good idea. Someone's definitely going to notice!  
**Zaveid**:	 I don't wanna grow up to be the kinda guy who views everything as a win or lose situation!  
**Zaveid**:	 The trickling sweat, the flushed red cheeks... there is a healthy, sublime beauty in this closed space we call a sauna!  
**Zaveid**:	 Sorey... Lets go hunting for babes.  
**Mikleo**:	 Whew, that sure was therapeutic! Why don't you guys step in as well?  
**Sorey**:	 You mean like this?  
**Zaveid**:	 That's not the kind of babe hunting I'm talking about!  
**Mikleo**:	 Huh?  

## Sauna Chat: Men's Angle
**Zaveid**:	 Where's Lailah and the others?  
**Sorey**:	 They said that they'll be at the sauna.  
**Zaveid**:	 Alright! Let's all go together! That means you too, Mikboy!  
**Mikleo**:	 I'll pass.  
**Zaveid**:	 Unacceptable! As men, we need to be open and... yah blah blah blah, something something!  
**Mikleo**:	 What's with you guys!  
**Mikleo**:	 So hey, fun fact: popular theory has it that the prototype for saunas was originally a smokehouse.  
**Zaveid**:	 Alright, time to read the wind! I got this!  
**Sorey**:	 Hmm. So either way, it came from the northern regions. And then I guess spread across the Glenwood continent from there?  
**Mikleo**:	 It's quite a mystery if you think about it.  
**Zaveid**:	 No, not Edna! Maybe in another 3000 years or so, hah!  
**Sorey**:	 Maybe it's because the entire continent used to be super cold?  
**Zaveid**:	 Past the heat waves and beyond! Go!  
**Mikleo**:	 Is that even possible?  
**Sorey**:	 Oh right! That tree stump from Volgran Forest!  
**Mikleo**:	 Dezel mentioned how there was a period where the sunlight was rather weak.  
**Zaveid**:	 Ouch, my wind got blocked! Must be Lailah's fire!  
**Mikleo**:	 What an unexpected discovery.  
**Sorey**:	 We might be able to prove something historic!  
**Sorey, Mikleo, Zaveid**:	 Whew...  
**Sorey, Mikleo, Zaveid**:	 Sure is hot...  

## Sauna Chat: Ladies's Angle
**Edna**:	 It's so loud in the guys sauna.  
**Rose**:	 Sorey and Mikleo are probably having some sort of conversation about the history of sauna or something like that.  
**Lailah**:	 Like a "how did sauna spread to the rest of the world?" sort of discussion.  
**Rose**:	 Yeah, yeah.  
**Edna**:	 Not to mention one gross perv among them.  
**Lailah**:	 Don't worry. I've burnt all those creepy winds coming our way.  
**Rose**:	 What stupidity. They need to learn to just relax and enjoy this paradise of heat!  
**Lailah**:	 Yes. I feel as if it's purifying my body and soul...  
**Edna**:	 To not even be able to appreciate a time like this, guys sure are...  
**Rose**:	 ...childish.  
**Lailah**:	 ...bratty.  
**Edna**:	 ...children.
