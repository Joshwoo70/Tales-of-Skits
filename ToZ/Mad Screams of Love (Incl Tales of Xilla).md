**Sorey**:   Whoa... There's, like, infinite books!  
**Mikleo**:  Just what you'd expect from a royal palace. Quite a collection of rare and valuable tomes.  
**Sorey**:   Lots that deal with history and ancient relics, too. Rrrrggh, I just wanna sit and read 'em all.  
**Lailah**:  Oh my, this book has an interesting title.  
**Sorey**:   "Mad Screams of Love." A poetry book, maybe?  
**Mikleo**:  Let's check it out.  
**Sorey**:   Gahh, careful, it's gonna look like the book's floating in midair!  
**Mikleo**:  Don't worry. Alisha'll handwave it away for us somehow.  
**Sorey**:   Oh, for... Here, gimme. I'll hold it.  
**Mikleo**:  Wow... mad is right.  
**Lailah**:  An ode to young passions! A lonely voice, screaming love and anguish to the heavens!  
**Mikleo**:  You just know the author's gonna look back at this ten years later and cringe. Angsty doesn't even begin to cover it.  
**Lailah**:  (*Blushing*) So that's what's so "mad" about it!  
**Sorey**:   Really? It all sounds pretty good to me.  
**Mikleo**:  Huh?  
**Lailah**:  Huh?  
**Mikleo**:  (*Facepalming*)Sorey, I think that's because you're so...  
**Lailah**:  (*Blushing*)So inherently enthusiastic.  
**Sorey**:   You guys okay? You look kinda, uh, mad.  

**Peddler**: Phew, I'm exhausted.  
**Jude**:    That cargo looks pretty heavy.  
**Peddler**: They're all books, and yes, they really are. Who knew paper could be so heavy?  
**Peddler**: But if you buy some from me, it would really help to lighten my load!  
**Jude**:    What kind of books are they?  
**Peddler**: Oh, I've got all sorts of rare finds.  
**Peddler**: Like this first edition of ""The Chronicles of Kresnik""! This baby would fetch five million gald at auction, easy.  
**Peddler**: Next, we have the fabled book of battle tactics from the legendary Ilbert the Conductor, titled ""The Complete Tactician"".  
**Peddler**: Not only that, it's a limited edition that contains a supplemental volume of the Conductor's poetry, titled ""Mad Screams of Love"".   
**Jude**:    The Conductor's poetry?!  
**Alvin**:   ""Mad Screams of Love""?  
**Rowen**:   H-How did that get on the market?!  
**Alvin**:   You've got yourself a sale.  
**Peddler**: Thank you very much!  
**Rowen**:   W-Wait!  
**Rowen**:   Surely all of us have done foolish things in our youths that we'd be embarrassed to confront today!  
**Rowen**:   Aren't we, as adults, supposed to turn a blind eye to such things in order to spare others from their shame?  
**Jude**:    I've never seen Rowen like this.  
**Jude**:    I'm ashamed to say it, but that only makes me want to read it all the more.  
**Jude**:    I guess that makes me a child still.  
**Alvin**:   The only shame here would be abandoning that healthy, youthful curiosity in an attempt to seem more grown-up than you are.  
**Alvin**:   Real men have to hold onto their childlike curiosity for as long as they can.  
**Alvin**:   Which is why I'm going to indulge mine with this special-edition copy of Rowen's masterwork.  
**Jude**:    Sounds good to me!  
**Rowen**:   H-How cruel!  
**Peddler**: Oh no, I'm so sorry! This book has already been sold to another buyer.  
**Peddler**: Someone in Sharilton who already paid in full.  
**Rowen**:   Oh my... That was a close one!  
**Alvin**:   Aww. You've broken my heart.  
**Peddler**: I am so sorry! Perhaps I could offer you a free copy of this book by way of an apology?  
**Peddler**: It's an equally rare treasure itself! Enjoy!  

STR_SUB_307_030_0_001 Oh, hello Rowen.  
STR_SUB_307_030_0_002 My lady, I couldn't help but notice that you appear a bit flushed. I hope you haven't caught a fever? "
STR_SUB_307_030_0_003 I have caught a fever! A fever born from great passion! 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_004 I was so moved by the poetry you wrote in ""Mad Screams of Love"".  
STR_SUB_307_030_0_005 What! You don't mean... You were the one who bought that book?! 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_006 Yes! I must have read it aloud dozens of times! 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_007 The passion you exude in your screaming about love and pain is just incredible! 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_008 I, uh... I was quite young back then, and... Well...  
STR_SUB_307_030_0_009 We need to republish this, and make it available for all the world to read! "
STR_SUB_307_030_0_010 No, please! Anything but that! "
STR_SUB_307_030_0_011 Are you sure? 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_012 I am quite adamant! 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_013 Then, would you at least do me the honor of signing my copy? "
STR_SUB_307_030_0_014 Only if you promise never to read it aloud again. 
STR_SUB_307_030_0_015 Very well. It will be our little secret.
