**Lailah**:  *I could Say I'm a fan of this paper fan... No that's too easy.*  
**Rose**:    You still awake? Oh, hey. I think this is the first time I've seen you with your hair down.  
**Lailah**:  I need to set it properly to make sure it doesn't get in the way during battle.  
**Rose**:    Styling is a pain! I just cut mine when it gets too long.  
**Lailah**:  Well I think you have radiant hair.  
**Rose**:    You really think so? How long did it take you to grow your hair?  
**Lailah**:  I can't really recall a time when my hair was short, honestly.  
**Rose**:    You mean you can't remember because it was so long ago? You have been around for a while and all.  
**Lailah**:  Indeed. When you've been around as long as I have, you forget even what you had for dinner two nights ago.  
**Rose**:    Pretty sure even humans can't remember that!  
**Lailah**:  I don't remember the first word I learned to say, either.  
**Rose**:    Yeah, once again, welcome to the world of mortals.
