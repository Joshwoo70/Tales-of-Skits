**Lailah**:  What a resplendent fountain.  
**Rose**:  Yeah. It's one of the famous sights of Pendrago.  
**Rose**:  I don't know a lot about it, but supposedly, the water's piped in from afar through an underground channel.  
**Lailah**:  Oh, I see.  
**Edna**:  So much work for something that doesn't even serve any purpose.  
**Edna**:  Stupid, simple humans.  
**Lailah**:  Well, considering their lack of seraphic artes, I think their technological advancement is commendable.  
**Edna**:  Useless. Pointless. Waste of effort.  
**Rose**:  It's also known as the Fountain of Wrath.  
**Lailah**:  "Wrath"? Why do they call it that?  
**Rose**:  Something with the piping's all messed up. Every now and then...  
**Edna**:  (*Screaming*) Aaaaughhh!

**Edna**:  ...  
**Rose**:  Like that.  
**Edna**:  Oh dear.  
**Edna**:  Stupid, stupid humans!
