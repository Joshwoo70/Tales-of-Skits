**Rose**:	 Phew! Didn't mess up this time.  
**Zaveid**:	 Hey, Rose. Whatcha making?  
**Rose**:	 Oh, just baumkuchen. I used to be flawless at making them.  
**Rose**:	 But these days it's like I can't do it without messing up a little bit.  
**Sorey**:	 Yet today, you were able to make them just fine, huh.  
**Rose**:	 Yup.  
**Rose**:	 Here you go! Feast your tastebuds on this Sparrowfeathers-brand baumkuchen! Satisfaction guaranteed!  
**Edna**:	 *Surprised* I'd give that a 95.  
**Sorey**:	 It's delicious!  
**Lailah**:	 *Blushing* It's so moist and soft! And perfectly sweet, but not cloyingly so!  
**Mikleo**:	 And the sugar coating just accentuates it so well!  
**Zaveid**:	 The key ingredients are honey and melon juice, I presume.  
**Rose**:	 How'd you know? I was sure you guys wouldn't figure it out!  
**Zaveid**:	 It's 'cause I can read the wind! Just like he would've thought to do.  
**Rose**:	 I see. So even there, he was helping me the whole time...  
**Rose**:	 Thanks, Dezel.
