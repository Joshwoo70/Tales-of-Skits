**Alisha**:	 Sorey, isn't that technically a ritual sword? If it was originally purely for decoration, I'm surprised you've become so adept with it. 
**Sorey**:	 Yeah? It's sort of a symbol, I guess. "I take no more life than is necessary to eat."
**Mikleo**:	 I thought it was just the first thing you ever found in the ruins.  
**Sorey**:	 Well, sure, initially, but... 
**Alisha**:	 And I'm guessing you chose a staff, Mikleo, to compensate for being shorter than Sorey when you two were training.  
**Mikleo**:	 I-I think there's a grave misunderstanding here!  
**Alisha**:	 Oh! I'm very sorry! I didn't realize the topic of your height difference was so sensitive!  
**Mikleo**:	 I'm not sensitive! I just didn't--  
**Sorey**:	 Don't pick on her, Mikleo.  
**Mikleo**:	 On HER? She's picking on ME!
