**Velvet**: An inspection!  
**Eizen**: They won't inspect everyone. Just act natural.  
**Magilou**: Your face is all stiff.  
**Velvet**: I know.  
**Guard**: You, in the black coat. Show me your documentation.  
**Velvet**: Uh... Um...  
**Guard**: Well? Your travel permit from the Abbey. Where is it?  
*Magilou Hits Velvet on the Head*  
**Magilou**: Foolish girl! How many times have I told you? A magicians apprentice must wear a pleasant grin!  
**Guard**: Magician?  
**Magilou**: Verily! I present to you the traveling troupe of mischievous misfits known across the land as... Magilou's Menagerie!  
**Guard**: Entertainment for the ceremony?  
**Magilou**: Why yes, indeed we are, my dear! Please pardon my uncouth apprentice.  
**Magilou**: Girl! Allay the good mans fears and show him the dove trick you've spent all these weeks on! Go to.  
**Velvet**: Huh?!  
**Velvet**: Oh, uh... Sorry, mistress... I forgot to prepare.  
**Magilou**: Y-Y-You pathetic little shirker! A proper performer is perpetually prepared!  
**Guard**: Its fine. Doves flying around would be a nuisance.  
**Magilou**: No, this will not do! If you cannot summon a dove, then ACT like one!  
**Magilou**: Act. Like. A. Dove!  
**Velvet**: *gives Magilou a Death Glare then turns back to the guard* .........Coo. Coo. *Blushes and Facepalms out of embarrassment*  
*Birds appear out of thin air from Magilou's artes*  
**Laphicet**: Whoa!  
**Magilou**: Remember, Magilou's Menagerie manufactures mirth! That was just a small sample for the good citizenry of Loegres!  
**Guard**: Hey! You cant advertise here! Move along!  
**Magilou**: As you say!
