**Jude**: My hands are still shaking. 
**Milla**: And for good reason. You were almost killed. 
**Jude**: I'm a civilian! Why would she attack me like that? 
**Milla**: I don't think she's part of Rashugal's army. 
**Jude**: If she's not a soldier, then what is she doing at a military facility? "
**Milla**: An ironic question for you or I to ask, don't you think? "
**Jude**: I see your point. 
**Jude**: Did you... Did you kill her? 
**Milla**: I'm not sure. I tried to go easy on her, but humans are so fragile. I keep having to tell the Four not to overdo it.  
**Jude**: I'm not really following you.
