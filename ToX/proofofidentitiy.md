**Jude**:   So, you're that Maxwell. Lord of Spirits, Ruler of Elements.
**Milla**:  You don't believe me? 
**Jude**:   A person claiming to be a spirit? It's a bit much to swallow. 
**Milla**:  Then how do you humans prove your identities to each other? 
**Jude**:   Well, by showing identification, I guess. I have a medical school ID card.  
**Milla**:  (*Disappinted*)Ah. Then I doubt that I'll be able to prove my identity to your satisfaction. 
**Milla**:  I wouldn't even know where to apply for a spirit ID card. 
**Jude**:   (*Down*)Is it really okay for me to be following this person?
