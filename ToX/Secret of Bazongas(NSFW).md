**Jude**:  Hey, Alvin. Why is Teepo always talking about "bazongas"? What does that even mean? "
**Alvin**: Oh-ho! He finally asks. It seems you're ready to take the first steps towards becoming a man. 
**Jude**:  Why do you have to make everything so weird? Forget I even asked. 
**Rowen**: Bazongas are the burning fire at the heart of manhood. 
**Jude**:  (*Suprised/Shocked*) Bwa! Rowen?! 
**Rowen**: (*Thinking*) Jude, there are times to play it cool, but a man who fears his own passions is no man at all.  
**Alvin**: Yes! Exactly what I was trying to say! 
**Jude**:  (*Blushing*) I'm not even sure I know what we're talking about. 
**Rowen**: (*Slightly Angry*) Then you will never know bazongas. You have to want it, Jude. You have to need it.  
**Jude**:  Then, teach me about bazongas.  
**Rowen**: (*Angry*)I can barely hear you. You have to mean it! 
**Jude**:  (*Inhaling,Alvin and Rowen Moves off,Milla and Leia Enters*)... 
**Jude**:  (*Shouting*) TEACH ME ABOUT BAZONGAS!!! 
**Leia**:  (*Shocked*) Whoa! Don't go shouting things like that! 
**Milla**: Don't scold him, Leia. I read about this in a book. It's called "*puberty*".  
**Milla**: We're supposed to be understanding and supportive. 
**Jude**:  (*Blushing*) Mmhmm...
**Alvin**: Don't hate us. 
**Rowen**: There's No shame in being burned by the fire of manhood.
