**Milla**: Are you finished here?  
**Jude**: Huh?  
**Milla**: I assume you had some reason for coming to this place?  
**Jude**: I was worried because Professor Haus hadn't come back, but he's...  
**Milla**: One of the people who died while connected to that machine?  
**Jude**: Yeah. I can't believe it. The Professor had been so excited about the request from Orda Palace.  
**Milla**: I see.  
**Milla**: Hmm? Yes. Yes, I suppose so.  
**Jude**: Huh?  
**Jude**: W-Wait for me!
