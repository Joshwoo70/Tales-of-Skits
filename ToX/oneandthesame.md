**Jude**:  Milla Maxwell? It must be pretty weird having the same name as the Lord of Spirits. 
**Milla**: Not at all. We are one and the same. 
**Jude**:  I'm sorry? 
**Milla**: I am Maxwell, Lord of Spirits.  
**Jude**:  (*Ablack*) What?! Come on! You're totally human! You... (*Looks closer*)
**Jude**:  (*Blushing*)...look just like a normal woman. 
**Milla**: I would hope so. That is the form I created for myself. 
**Milla**: The form you created?
