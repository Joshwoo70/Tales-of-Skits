(*Velvet see's her own dead body after killing the beast, she's taken a back.*)  
**Velvet**: (*Shocked*) I... Im dead... Im dead....  
**Laphicet**: Calm down, Velvet! This farce is just another of Innominat's illusions!  
**Innominat**: "Farce?" How callous. That "farce" is the true face of my sister.  
**Innominat**: She hates, resents, devours, and kills.  
**Innominat**: She tramples people, cities, everything, living only by her emotions...  
**Innominat**: What an ugly, tainted soul.  
**Laphicet**: Its not like that!  
**Innominat**: Nothing you say will matter. She knows. She knows if its the truth.  
**Velvet**: ... He's right.  
**Velvet**:. Just think. Everything I did was baseless, arrogant... And even so, I still....  
**Innominat**:. You hurt so many innocent people, didnt you?  
**Velvet**:. More than I can count... I devoured and killed so many...  
**Innominat**:. Without even knowing Arthurs true aims....  
**Velvet**: I destroyed people... I destroyed whole towns....  
**Innominat**:. And worse yet, you didnt even show mercy to your own sister's reincarnation.  
**Velvet**:. I... ate her...  
**Innominat**:. And despite all of that, I still love you, Velvet. Thats why I chose to become a sacrifice. For you, sister.  
**Innominat**:. But think, if you try to stop the resurrection, wouldnt my death be all for nothing?  
**Innominat**:. To tell you the truth, I was terrified of dying. It was so dark...  
**Velvet**: Im sorry... I-Im so sorry...  
**Innominat**:. Youll accept it, then? That everything youve done up untilthis point, all of it...  
**Velvet**: Yes. It was all for nothing, for no one.  
**Velvet**: I hurt so many people, all for no reason. Im a monster.  
**Innominat**:. If you've accepted it, you have to atone for your sins.
**Innominat**:. Once I eat the final two malevolences inside you, I'll fully awaken. Give them to me. Give me your hatred, your despair.  
**Innominat**:. If you do, I can cleanse this world of all its pain.  
**Innominat**:. I had hoped... that you could live in a world without painand sadness.  
**Innominat**:. But You're a monster now. You Don't belong there.  
**Laphicet**:. Velvet!  
_170_210_039. Let me go... I have to go....  
**Laphicet**:. No...!  
_170_210_041. If you Don't... You'll die too for no reason. 
**Laphicet**:. No! 
_170_210_043. A twisted monster like me doesnt deserve to live... Dontyou understand?. 
**Innominat**:. You're the reincarnation of the first sacrifice. Part of me Don't worry. Ill devour you too.  
_170_210_047. Laphicet, tell this self-absorbed idiot what she needs to hear! 
_170_210_048. Please, let me go.... 

**Laphicet**:. Will you STOP WHINING?! 
**Velvet**:. Hu--?!. 
**Laphicet**:. No, I Don't "understand"! 
**Laphicet**:. You snap at people! You're scary! You--You tried to eat me! 
**Laphicet**:. But... You're also kind... And You're filled with life! 
**Laphicet**:. I Don't understand a single thing about you!. 
**Laphicet**:. But you gave me a name, when I was a number!. 
**Laphicet**:. You gave me that compass! You taught me what it meant to be alive!
**Laphicet**:. Thats why I care about you, Velvet! Ill protect you for myown sake!. 
**Velvet**: Phi.... 
**Laphicet**:. I Don't care if You're malevolent! Or if it was pointless!. 
**Laphicet**:. If the world says its a mistake to love you, Ill fight thewhole world! I Don't care HOW much pain you feel!. 
**Laphicet**:. It doesnt matter! A world without you, Velvet... 
**Laphicet**:. Gggnngh... is the one thing I couldnt bear!.
_170_210_064. Let me go... My hand will.... 
**Laphicet**:. Eat my arm. I Don't care. Just... leave me the other one. 
**Laphicet**:. I need it to clobber the jerk who made my Velvet cry! 
_170_210_067. I... I loved them all.... 
_170_210_068. I loved Laphi, and Celica... Arthur, everyone.... 
_170_210_069. To have it all stolen from me... Why them? Why not me?. 
_170_210_070. It hurt so much!. 
_170_210_071. Your despair... How is it gone?!

_170_210_072. A flame burns in my heart, too. A flame I cannot quench, nomatter how hard I try. Just like you, Velvet. 
_170_210_073.... I finally understand how you felt. 
_170_210_074. But the only one I can fight for... is myself.  
_170_210_075. Thats good enough. Thats proof that you are truly alive.
