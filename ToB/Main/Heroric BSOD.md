(*Velvet see's her own dead body after killing the beast, she's taken a back. She screams in anguish.*)  
**Eleanor**:   (*Shocked*)I-Is that..?  
**Velvet**:    (*Shocked*) I... I'm dead... I'm dead....  
**Laphicet**:  (*Angrily*) Calm down, Velvet! This farce is just another of Innominat's illusions!  
(*Innominat fades in.*)  
**Innominat**:  "Farce?" How callous. That "farce" is the true face of my sister.  
(*Velvet Gasps. Flashbacks of events in the story*)  
**Innominat**:  She hates, resents, devours, and kills.  
**Innominat**:  She tramples people, cities, everything, living only by her emotions...  
**Innominat**:  What an ugly, tainted soul.  
**Laphicet**:   (*Angrily*) Its not like that!  
**Innominat**:  Nothing you say will matter. She knows. She knows if its the truth.  
**Velvet**:     ... He's right.  
(*Velvet Kneels down on the floor*)  
**Velvet**:.    (*Realization*) Just think. Everything I did was baseless, arrogant... And even so, I still....  
**Innominat**:  You hurt so many innocent people, didn't you?  
**Velvet**:     More than I can count... I devoured and killed so many...  
**Innominat**:  Without even knowing Arthurs true aims....  
**Velvet**:     I destroyed people... I destroyed whole towns....  
**Innominat**:  And worse yet, you didn't even show mercy to your own sister's reincarnation.  
**Velvet**:     (*Voice Breaking*) I... ate her...  
**Innominat**:  And despite all of that, I still love you, Velvet. Thats why I chose to become a sacrifice. For you, sister.  
**Innominat**:  But think, if you try to stop the resurrection, wouldnt my death be all for nothing?  
**Innominat**:  To tell you the truth, I was terrified of dying. It was so dark...  
**Velvet**:     (*Crying*) I'm sorry... I-I'm so sorry...  
**Innominat**:  You'll accept it, then? That everything you've done up until this point, all of it...  
**Velvet**:     (*Crying*) Yes. It was all for nothing, for no one.  
**Velvet**:     (*Crying*) I hurt so many people, all for no reason. I'm a monster.  
**Innominat**:  If you've accepted it, you have to atone for your sins.  
**Innominat**:  Once I eat the final two malevolences inside you, I'll fully awaken. Give them to me. Give me your hatred, your despair.  
**Innominat**:  If you do, I can cleanse this world of all its pain.  
**Innominat**:  I had hoped... that you could live in a world without pain and sadness.  
**Innominat**:  But You're a monster now. You Don't belong there.  

**Laphicet**:   (*Shouting*) Velvet!  
(*Laphicet Rushes to grab Velvet by her hand, Eleanor and Rokurou are pushed backwards, Eizen see the Fake Velvet's body being eaten up by a mouth coming from the arte.*)  
**Velvet**:     Let me go... I have to go....  
**Laphicet**:   (*Refusing*) No...!  
**Velvet**:     If you Don't... You'll die too for no reason.  
**Laphicet**:   No!  
**Velvet**:      (*Voice Breaking*) A twisted monster like me doesn't deserve to live...(*Sobbing*) Don't you understand?  
**Laphicet**:   Grrgh!  
**Innominat**:  You're the reincarnation of the first sacrifice. Part of me Don't worry. Ill devour you too.  
**Eizen**:      Laphicet, tell this self-absorbed idiot what she needs to hear!  
(*Eizen hold Laphicet by his leg and chaining himself to the ground using artes.*)  
**Velvet**:     Please, let me go.... 

**Laphicet**:  (*Shouting*) Will you STOP WHINING?!  
**Velvet**:    Hu--?!  
(*True Will plays in the Background*)  
**Laphicet**:  No, I Don't "understand"!  
**Laphicet**:  You snap at people! You're scary! You--You tried to eat me!  
**Laphicet**:  But... You're also kind... And You're filled with life!  
**Laphicet**:  I Don't understand a single thing about you!  
**Laphicet**:  But you gave me a name, when I was a number!  
**Laphicet**:  You gave me that compass! You taught me what it meant to be alive!  
**Laphicet**:  Thats why I care about you, Velvet! Ill protect you for my own sake!  
**Velvet**:    Phi....  
**Laphicet**:  I Don't care if You're malevolent! Or if it was pointless!  
**Laphicet**:  (*Screaming*) If the world says its a mistake to love you, Ill fight the whole world! I Don't care HOW much pain you feel!  
**Laphicet**:  It doesn't matter! A world without you, Velvet...  
(*Velvet Demon Arm Starts Eating Laphicet in Instinct*)  
**Laphicet**:  Gggnngh... is the one thing I couldn't bear!  
**Velvet**:    Let me go... My hand will....  
**Laphicet**:  Eat my arm. I Don't care. Just... leave me the other one.  
**Laphicet**:  I need it to clobber the jerk who made my Velvet cry!  
**Velvet**:    (*sobbing*) I... I loved them all....  
**Velvet**:    (*sobbing*) I loved Laphi, and (*crying*) Celica... Arthur, everyone...  
**Velvet**:    (*voice breaking*) To have it all stolen from me... Why them? Why not me?  
**Velvet**:    (*sobbing*) IT HURT SO MUCH!  
**Innominat**: (*Surprised*)Your despair... How is it gone?!  
(*The Arte Shatters Innominat falls to the ground, The Earthen Historia Plays a Segment.*)  
**Seres**:     A flame burns in my heart, too. A flame I cannot quench, no matter how hard I try. Just like you, Velvet.  
**Velvet**:    ... I finally understand how you felt.  
**Velvet**:    But the only one I can fight for... is myself.  
**Seres**:     (*Smiling*) Thats good enough. Thats proof that you are truly alive.  
(*Velvet Reaches out to Seres with her Demon Arm.
Seres Vanishes into a burning flame,The Earthen Historia Disappears in a flash.
Reaching towards her heart, she pledges. Turns around towards the closing earthpulse.
She Forces the Earthpulse to open again.
