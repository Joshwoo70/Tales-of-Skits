**Bienfu**:      M-Miss Magilou!  
**Magilou**:   Don't... Don't worry... If Velvet could do it... Theres noway I cant.... 
_180_010_003. How many times do you plan to destroy and rebuild your own heart, Magilou?. 
_180_010_004. Were on a hundred and seven... Or was it a hundred and eight.  ? I lost count... Heh... Not that I really care.  
_180_010_005. Pathetic fool.  
_180_010_006. Did I not tell you it would require an iron will, as indomitable as the very trees that live and die across millennia?. 
_180_010_007. Gnngh... Like you, I suppose... Or that boy over there.  ?. 
_180_010_008. That is the foundation of an ideal world, one free from mans sins. 
_180_010_009. Heh... An ideal world, huh? 
_180_010_010. You. Kid. The boy who was your companion... Laphicet. He's alive. 
_180_010_011. Chasing a terrifying daemon girl, he has learned the immensity of the seas and weathered the dry wastes of the land.  
_180_010_012. Those people... They're different from us... Despite the pain, the anguish, they embrace the life they've been given. 
_180_010_013. They live, undaunted by the ugliness of the world!. 
_180_010_015. So You're doing this all for them? Is that what this is?. 
_180_010_016. Hehe... Not even close. They aggravate me to my wits end.  
_180_010_017. Like stabs in the chest, over and over and over. And thats exactly why.... 
_180_010_018. Thats why... I intend to see how all of this ends... I won't be satisfied until I do!. 
_180_010_019. Words bereft of meaning. You truly are my greatest failure. 
_180_010_020. Gosh... Funny just how little I care... 
_180_010_021. No! Please! 
_180_010_023. Let me guess... We came at a good time? 
_180_010_024. You're late! Because of you, I had to have a really boring conversation!  
_180_010_025. So, you came face-to-face with Innominat. 
_180_010_026. If so, then you must know that your quest for revenge is utterly meaningless. 
_180_010_027. Yeah, I did.... 
_180_010_028. I know why sadness fills the world, and I know how deep are the burdens of sin. 
_180_010_029. I tried to abandon my memories of Arthur and Laphi, to cut myself off from it all, and end this tragedy.  
_180_010_030. Its... Its what they would have wanted. 
_180_010_031. Exactly. You do well to know your place.  
_180_010_032. But thats exactly why I cant forgive them....  
_180_010_033. Not Artorius, not Innominat....  
_180_010_034. I know my heart is ugly and full of contradictions.  
_180_010_035. But those days we spent together in familial warmth.  They're proof that I... that all of us... were truly alive.  
_180_010_036. Thats why, no matter how hard, no matter how sad it gets....  
_180_010_037. I will take my vengeance to the very end!  
_180_010_038. Velvet!  
_180_010_039. Don't be a fool! Just give up and die like you ought! It is your destiny to wallow in despair!  
_180_010_040. You take my family, turn me into a monster, and you want my soul, too?  
_180_010_041. Now who's being the fool?  
_180_010_042. Remember this well. The Lord of Calamity never gives up, not even in the face of death.  
_180_010_043. Have you no shame for your sins, you unholy monster?  
_180_010_046. Let me in on this! I lost a bet, and I've got some anger to work out!  
_180_010_047. You sure you can fight in your condition?  
_180_010_048. Who do you think I am?!  
_180_010_049. Oooh, I thought you'd never ask! I am the dastardly witch Magilou, scourge of self-righteous exorcists!  
_180_010_050. Now face the wrath of Magilou Mayvin!  
_180_010_051. Fools, all of you!
