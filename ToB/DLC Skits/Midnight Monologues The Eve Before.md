**Magilou**: The Show has started! Time for a special performance by Magilou's Menagerie!  
**Magilou**: It's Magilou's Midnight Monologues!  
**Rokurou**: *Surprised* Wow! That's a huge crowd!  
**Velvet**:  What's going on, Magilou?  
**Eleanor**: No one said a word to me about this!  
**Magilou**: It's simple. The guest draws a topic card, and we have a discussion about that topic.  
**Magilou**: And as your esteemed hostess, I'll be digging up each of your most embarrassing secrets.  
**Magilou**: But don't worry, it'll only make your more endearing to the audience, so be grateful and fess up!  
**Magilou**: ... So, now you know!  
**Eizen**:   I see, I didn't know we were going to be part of this show.  
**Eleanor**: This is all a little sudden for me.  
**Laphicet**:I'm not sure I can talk... in front of everyone.  
**Rokurou**: I don't mind. A swordsman is always ready to fight, and to speak his mind.  
**Velvet**:  *Slightly irritated* Leave me out of it. I don't see any point in talking in front of a--  
*The crowd gets agitated*  
**Velvet**:  Urk!  
**Magilou**: Bienfu has already warmed up the crowd. There's no escaping this.  
**Eleanor**: *thinking* Bienfu... is good at the most random things.  
**Velvet**:  But I don't want anything to do with this crazy--  
**Magilou**: Velvet... You of all people should know the world is made up of crazy things and random happenings.  
**Magilou**: It's easy to run away from trouble and hardship, but that can start a habit of running.  
**Magilou**: Tell me... Do you think a coward who runs away from all their fights will ever be able to get their revenge?  
**Velvet**:  *glares* I'm not afraid of anything! Your talk show doesn't scare me!  
**Magilou**: That's the spirit! Just spit it all out-- *Velvet is shocked* Er, tell it like it is! *Velvet Face palms*  
**Magilou**: We'll give a part of a secret word each week, so be sure to stay until the end!  
**Velvet**:  Damn! How couldI fall for that?  
**Eizen**:   Magilou can be convincing. Gotta be careful.  
**Laphicet**:Wh-What's she going to make us say?
