**Magilou**:  (*Unamused, Slightly Sweating*) Is that.. something you can talk here?  
**Rokurou**:  Yeah. It went surprising well.  
**Rokurou**:  It started off by cuttin' the poor guy's head off with my first swing.  
(*Crowd Whispers*)  
**Velvet**:   (*Slightly angry, Laphicet is Afraid*) Rokurou, I'm not sure this is appropriate!  
**Rokurou**:  (*sinister Smile*) Next, I stabbed him in the stomach and sliced upward, spilling his guts out.  
(*Crowd Whispers*)  
**Rokurou**:  (*Eleanor is gritting her teeth while Eizen looks away Nervously*) Then I cut along his spine, peeled all his flesh back and ripped out his bones!(*Eleanor and Eizen closes their eyes.*)  
**Rokurou**:  And that... is how I prepared my first fresh mackerel.  
(*Crowd Laughs*)
