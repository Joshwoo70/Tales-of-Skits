The Abbey Inquisition  
**Eizen**: Trouble at Loegress.  
**Velvet**: Oh. What kind of trouble?  
**Eizen**: One on't the Bloodwin has been executed.  
**Velvet**: I don't understand what you're saying.  
**Eizen**: [slightly irritatedly and with exaggeratedly clear accent] One of the Bloodwing agent has been executed.  
**Velvet**: Well what on earth does this have to do with us?  
**Eizen**: I don't know - Rokurou just told me to come in here and say that there was trouble at Loegress... that's all - I didn't expect a kind of Abbey Inquisi-  

***Jaring sound***  
**Eleanor**: Nobody expects the Abbey Inquisition!  
**Laphicet**: Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as: Malaks, Artes, The populus, an almost fanatical devotion to the Shepeard-  
**Magilou**: And nice white and blue Uniforms!  
**Eleanor**: Oh Damn! Magilou! *Laphicet*... Read the charges.  
**Laphicet**: You are hereby charged that you did on diverse dates commit heresy against the Holy Abbey.  
**Eleanor**: Now how do you plead?  
**Velvet**: Innocent.  
**Eleanor**(Slightly Sweating) : Thats ridiculous!  
**Magilou**: We'll soon change your mind about that!
