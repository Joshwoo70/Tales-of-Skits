**Insistent Boy**    I can't deal with this anymore!  
**Eleanor**          What's the matter?  
**Insistent Boy**    Everyones sick of all these fruit-flavored gels, Right?  
**Eleanor**          Umm...  
**Insistent Boy**    So I made gels using the giant cacao beans only found here on this island. It gave them a nice bitter chocolate taste.  
**Insistent Boy**    But people complained that they weren't "avant-gardy" enough. "Ugh, chocolate flavored gels, how prosaic." Bah!  
**Insistent Boy**    This got me fuming, so I caught some maiden Bonito fish you find 'round here, ground em up, and made some gels with em.  
**Eleanor**          You put fish... into chocolate gels?  
**Rokurou**          People do braise meat with chocolate... Chocolate and fish may go surprisingly well together.  
**Insistent Boy**    Exactly! It was the discovery of a century!  
**Insistent Boy**    The Bonito flakes crunchiness and the gels gumminess made for an exquisitely bad combo, which made it interesting!  
**Rokurou**          So if you made an innovative new type of gel, why are you so angry?  
**Insistent Boy**    That's exactly my problem... I outdid myself! Now I need to make my gels world debut as amazing as they are!  
**Insistent Boy**    So I thought up the ultimate plan....  
**Laphicet**         And that is?  
**Insistent Boy**    I'll put my choconito gels in toilets all over the world! I call it... "The Great Choconito Toilet Gambit!"  
**Insistent Boy**    No one will go to the bathroom without finding my gels! I think everyone will have a lot of fun! So? Genius, right?!  
**Laphicet**         Ha ha... Yeah! It's weird, but I think it's funny, too.  
**Insistent Boy**    Right?! I knew that kids would get it!  
**Laphicet**         Whos a kid?  
**Insistent Boy**    But all the adults in my village called it silly and "lowbrow!" They forbade me from selling my choconito gels at all....  
**Insistent Boy**    Isn't that just horrible?  
**Velvet**           That's a ridiculous thing I've ever heard...  
**Insistent Boy**    Ah man... Things used to be so much better...  
**Insistent Boy**    Mom would make me dinner, and all I had to do was "googoogoo gah" and everyone would smile and praise me....  
**Insistent Boy**    I Don't want to become the kind of grown-up who can't find any fun in looking for gels in toilets....
