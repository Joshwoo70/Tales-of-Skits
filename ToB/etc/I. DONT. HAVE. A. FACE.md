**Dyle:** Hey, Kurogane, lemme ask you somethin!  
**Kurogane:** More complaining, is it?  
**Dyle:** Cmon, don't be like that!  
**Dyle:** Every time I turn around Velvet or one of the pirates is telling me to go make some delivery to some island. I can never get a break.  
**Kurogane:** Isn't that just a sign they think you're a dependable guy?  
**Dyle:** Maybe, but I don't see them sending you off on errands. Its like they take one look at your face and decide to leave you alone.  
**Kurogane:** I don't have a face.  
**Dyle:** Oh, right, sorry. Slip of the tongue.  
**Kurogane:** Maybe you just don't know how much work I do around here Its more than you think. Anything to do with iron, I do it Making tools, repairing things....  
**Kurogane:** What do you take me for, some kind of cheeky freeloader? I don't even have cheeks!  
**Dyle:** Ha ha ha, you're too funny! But doesn't it ever annoy you to have all these kids giving you orders?  
**Kurogane:** Ive spent my entire life thinking of nothing but forging swords. Its been centuries since Ive interacted with youngsters like them.  
**Kurogane:** They can be a hassle, but at least its a new hassle...  
**Dyle:** Yeah, thats what I thought at first, so I went along with whatever they asked...  
**Dyle:** But Ive been too nice, so they keep pushing work onto me Maybe if I hadn't been so helpful, they would've stayed out of my face like they stay out of yours.  
**Kurogane:** I. DON'T. HAVE. A. FACE.  
**Dyle:** Thats not the point! Aren't you even listening to what I'm saying here?!  
**Dyle:** You need to make up your mind.  
**Kurogane:** You and I got on this ship alongside these people who are putting themselves in great danger in order to live the lives of their choosing.  
**Kurogane:** If you don't like it, then go on and get off this ship with your tail between your legs.  
**Dyle:** Yeah, except I don't have a tail right now.
